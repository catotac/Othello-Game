The results of running the alpha-beta pruning at different depth search and evaluation function results in the following outputs:

	1) Depth = 2, Scores: user:20 agent:44
	2) Depth = 3, Scores: user:8 agent:26

As can be seen the AI designed based on alpha-beta pruning learns faster for greater depth size.
